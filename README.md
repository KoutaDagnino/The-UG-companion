# The-UG-companion

The Undergraduate companion to Theoretical physics is a set of 6 lecture notes on 
- Classical physics
- Electromagnetism
- Quantum mechanics
- Thermal and Statistical physics
- Modern physics
-  Mathematical methods 
which I have been working on throghout my studies at the Open University. 

Note that all the material has been prepared by me only and are not endorsed by the lecturers. They are not an accurate representation of the material taught, and any mistakes/typos are most definitely my fault. Read at your own risk!
